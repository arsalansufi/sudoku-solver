This project all started with an assignment in my introductory programming
class that had us program a simple Sudoku solver. The program took a text file
as an input, read in the Sudoku from the text file, solved the Sudoku if it
could, and printed the result to the console. The algorithm that the program
used was also very simple and only able to solve a small subset of Sudokus.
Over my freshman summer, in an effort to learn some web development, I decided
to take this program, improve the algorithm, and create an interactive
Sudoku-solving web app.

See the actual solver at arsalansudokusolver.appspot.com for the web app and
additional details about the algorithm and the code!

-- Update (1/11/2015) --

I'm revisiting this code for the first time in over a year and a half! I'm
hoping to clean things up, brush up on my Java, and better understand the
Google App Engine deployment process.
