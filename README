This project started with an assignment in my introductory programming class
that had us program a simple Sudoku solver. The program took a text file as an
input, read in the Sudoku from the text file, solved the Sudoku if it could,
and printed the result to the console. The algorithm that the program used was
also very simple and only able to solve a small subset of Sudokus. Over my
freshman summer, in an effort to learn some web development, I decided to take
this program, improve the algorithm, and create an interactive Sudoku-solving
web app.

The app runs a backtracking algorithm coded in a Java servlet, dynamically
loads its content via AJAX, and validates user input using jQuery's
form-validation plugin. I deployed the app using the Google App Engine.

See the actual solver at arsalansudokusolver.appspot.com for the web app and
additional details about the algorithm and the code!

-- Update (1/11/2015) --

I'm revisiting this code for the first time in over a year and a half. I'm
hoping to clean things up, brush up on my Java, and better understand the
Google App Engine deployment process.
